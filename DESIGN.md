## 1. Overview

This project implements a simplified blockchain-based **Decentralized Voting System** using a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture with UDP sockets. Each peer maintains its own blockchain, independently mines blocks containing a vote transaction, and exchanges blocks with other peers to achieve eventual consensus.

A tracker node helps coordinate peer discovery and liveness detection via heartbeat. Forks are resolved by adopting the **longest valid chain**. The system supports peer joins, departures, and synchronization after temporary disconnection.

‚úÖ Designed to satisfy project requirements for a minimum of 3 peers communicating over Google Cloud VMs.

‚úÖ Each peer acts as both a voter and miner.

## 2. Blockchain Design

### 2.1 Block Structure

Each block contains:

- `index`: Position in chain
- `timestamp`: Block creation timestamp
- `transactions`: List of vote transactions (one per block)
- `previous_hash`: Hash of the previous block
- `nonce`: Proof-of-work nonce
- `hash`: Computed SHA-256 hash of block contents

Implemented in `block.py`.

---

### 2.2 Mining & Consensus

- **Mining Trigger:** A peer mines a block **immediately upon submitting a vote** (no transaction pool).
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW):** The block is mined until its hash satisfies the configured difficulty (e.g., 2 leading zeroes).
- **Fork Handling:** If a received block conflicts with the local chain, the peer triggers a `REQUEST_CHAIN` protocol and switches to the longest valid chain.
- **Chain Synchronization:**
  - Peers only synchronize:
    - On fork detection
    - Explicit manual request
    - When starting up

There‚Äôs **no periodic chain sync** (lazy sync only upon events).

---

### 2.3 Genesis Block

‚úÖ Created automatically when each peer initializes `Blockchain()`.

‚úÖ Contains index 0, empty transactions, fixed timestamp, and a hardcoded hash.

This ensures all peers share the same genesis block.

---

## 3. Peer-to-Peer Protocol

### 3.1 Tracker Node

- Maintains **active peer list**
- Sends updated peer list to new peers
- Sends **heartbeat `POKE` messages every second**
- Removes peers after missing **3 consecutive `POKE_ACK` responses**

Implemented in `tracker_server.py`.

---

### 3.2 Peer Responsibilities

Each peer:

‚úÖ Registers with tracker (`REGISTER_PEER`)  
‚úÖ Receives list of peers  
‚úÖ Requests most recent chain upon first registering with tracker
‚úÖ Submits votes ‚Üí triggers mining ‚Üí broadcasts block  
‚úÖ Listens for `NEW_BLOCK` from other peers  
‚úÖ Verifies incoming blocks (hash, PoW, previous hash)  
‚úÖ Handles forks by requesting chain and adopting longest valid chain  
‚úÖ Responds to `POKE` from tracker with `POKE_ACK`

Implemented in `peer.py`.

### 4. Workflow

#### 4.1 Tracker Initialization

- The tracker node (tracker_server.py) starts and binds to a fixed UDP port.
- It initializes a list of allowed voting options (candidates).
- It maintains an active peer list, tracking:
- Peers that have registered
- Peers responding to periodic POKE heartbeats
- It begins sending POKE messages every second to all known peers.

#### 4.2 Peer Registration and Startup

- A peer (peer.py) starts and binds to a local UDP port.
- It sends a REGISTER_PEER message to the tracker, providing its IP/port.
- The tracker responds with a REGISTER_ACK message, containing:
  - The allowed voting options
  - A list of currently known peers
- The peer requests the voting options and stores the voting options in the application layer (client.py) for later use.
- Upon initial connection with the tracker, the peer sends a REQUEST_CHAIN message to known peers to synchronize its local blockchain with others.
- Any responding peer sends back one block at a time via CHAIN_BLOCK messages to reconstruct the chain incrementally.

#### 4.3 Vote Submission (Peer Voting)

- A peer‚Äôs user selects a candidate to vote for.
- The peer creates a Transaction object containing:
  - voter_id
  - candidate_id
  - timestamp
- The peer calls submit_vote():
- Adds the transaction to its blockchain‚Äôs pending transactions
- Immediately triggers mining a new block containing that transaction

#### 4.4 Block Mining (Proof-of-Work)

- The peer runs mine_block():
- Builds a Block object
- Tries nonce values until hash(block_data + nonce) satisfies the difficulty (e.g., 2 leading zeros)
- Once mined:

  - The block is appended to the peer‚Äôs local blockchain
  - A NEW_BLOCK message is broadcast to all known peers

#### 4.5 Block Propagation and Validation

- Each peer continuously listens for NEW_BLOCK messages from others.
- Upon receiving a new block:
- Validate:
  - Does previous_hash match local last block hash?
  - Does the block‚Äôs hash satisfy the difficulty?
- If valid and fits directly on the current chain ‚Üí append
- If index already exists but hash mismatches ‚Üí fork detected!
- Peer calls request_chain() to trigger a full chain sync
- If invalid (bad hash, broken link, invalid PoW):

  - Block is rejected
  - Chain sync may be triggered depending on detection

#### 4.6 Fork Resolution

- When a peer detects a fork (incoming block index already exists but hash mismatch):
- Sends REQUEST_CHAIN to peers
- Peers respond with one block at a time (CHAIN_BLOCK messages) to rebuild missing chain
- Peer replaces its local chain with the longer valid chain received

#### 4.7 Vote Tallying

- Each peer independently computes vote results from its local blockchain.
- Tally computed by iterating over blockchain.chain and counting votes in transactions.
- Result can be queried at any time. On the UI, the tally is displayed in real-time.
- Because all valid chains should converge to the same longest chain, results are consistent across peers.

#### 4.8 Peer Liveness and Failure Handling

- Each peer responds immediately with POKE_ACK.
- Tracker tracks consecutive missed responses:
- If a peer misses 3 consecutive POKE_ACK, it is removed from the peer list.
- Removed peers are excluded from further peer list updates sent to new peers.

#### 4.9 Peer Departure

- A peer can send LEAVE_PEER message to tracker before shutdown. This can be done by clicking on the 'Leave + Terminate' button on the UI.
- Tracker removes the peer immediately from active list.
- Remaining peers retain blockchain state.
- Alternatively, the user can CTRL+C to termiante the client.py program to initiate an ungraceful termination. The tracker will eventually remove the peer from the peer list due to the heartbeat mechanism.

#### üìù Key Differences from Standard Blockchain

‚úÖ No global transaction pool ‚Üí peer mines vote immediately

‚úÖ No automatic periodic chain sync ‚Üí sync only on fork or startup

‚úÖ Only 1 vote per block ‚Üí simplifies validation

‚úÖ Chain sync implemented as incremental 1-block-at-a-time responses (to avoid UDP size limits)

#### 4.10 Example Interaction Timeline

1. Tracker starts.
2. Peer A, B, C join ‚Üí send REGISTER_PEER ‚Üí get peer list + vote options.
3. Peer A votes ‚Üí mines block ‚Üí broadcasts NEW_BLOCK.
4. Peer B receives block ‚Üí validates ‚Üí appends.
5. Peer C votes ‚Üí mines its own block at same height ‚Üí broadcast NEW_BLOCK.
6. Peer A/B receive conflicting block ‚Üí detect fork ‚Üí send REQUEST_CHAIN.
7. Peer C responds with CHAIN_BLOCK (entire chain).
8. Peer A/B adopt longer chain ‚Üí discard shorter fork.
9. Peer B crashes ‚Üí tracker stops receiving POKE_ACK ‚Üí removes B.
10. Peer B rejoins ‚Üí sends REGISTER_PEER ‚Üí receives peer list ‚Üí sends REQUEST_CHAIN ‚Üí syncs chain.

### 6. Key Design Decisions

‚úÖ One transaction per block ‚Üí simplified mining & block broadcast

‚úÖ No transaction pool

‚úÖ Peers broadcast mined block, not transactions

‚úÖ Fork resolution via requesting chain only when fork detected

‚úÖ Tracker monitors liveness via POKE/POKE_ACK protocol

‚úÖ UDP for lightweight, lossy communication

---

### 7. Testing Notes

- Minimum 3 peers required for full demo
- Each peer submits at least 2 votes
- Validate:
  - Peers adopt longest chain after forks
  - Tracker correctly removes dead peers
  - NEW_BLOCK properly propagates across peers

---

### 8. Security Considerations

‚úÖ Cryptographic hash links blocks

‚úÖ Invalid blocks rejected at peer level

‚úÖ Votes immutable once mined

‚úÖ No vote anonymity ‚Üí voter_id stored as plain string

---
